# SuperChargers Recompiled: dev recipes. Run `just` with no arguments to list them. They are the same for
# all six games and live in skylanders-portal (just/game.just); this file only names the game.
#
# Needs CMake, Ninja, `just`, Git and clang (Windows: Visual Studio 2022 with "C++ Clang tools for
# Windows", plus Git for Windows); details in docs/development.md.

# Init/update every git submodule recursively: after a fresh clone, or after pulling a branch
# that added a new one.
